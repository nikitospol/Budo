					<h3>Kyudo</h3>
					<p> Kyudo, which literally means The Way of the Bow, is considered by many to be the purest of all the martial ways. In the past the Japanese bow was used for hunting, war, court ceremonies, games, and contests of skill. The old word for Japanese archery was kyujutsu (bow technique) which encompassed the skills and techniques of the warrior archer. Some of the ancient schools, known as ryu, survive today, along with the ancient ceremonies and games, but the days where the Japanese bow was used as a weapon are long past. Modern kyudo is practiced primarily as a method of physical, moral, and spiritual development.</p>

					<h3>Iaido</h3>
					<p> The art of a surprise attack or counterattack using a Japanese sword. Unlike kendo, it is not fencing itself that is studied here, but the instant defeat of the enemy with the blade initially sheathed. "Instant defeat" refers to the rapid exposure of the sword, followed by a blow in case of danger, for example, when the person sitting in front shows signs of aggression or takes up the sword. Also in this type of fencing there is no armor, as in kendo - a protective helmet, vest and gloves.</p>

					<h3>Aikido</h3>
					<p> A modern Japanese complex of physical and spiritual practices created by Morihei Ueshiba as a synthesis of his studies of martial arts, philosophy and religious beliefs. Most often, Aikido is translated as "the way of merging with vital energy" or "the way of harmonizing the spirit." Ueshiba's goal was to create an art whose practitioners would be able to protect not only themselves, but also the attacker from injury.</p>
